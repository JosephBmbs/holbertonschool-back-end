## Introduction

Welcome to the Employee Data API project. In this project, you will learn how to interact with an API to access employee data, organize it, and export it to various data structures. This project emphasizes the limitations of Bash scripting and the advantages of using Python for building efficient scripts.

## Background Context

Traditionally, system administrators relied on Bash scripting for various tasks. However, the newer generation of system administrators, often referred to as Site Reliability Engineers (SREs), possess broader programming skills beyond Bash. They manage systems using tools like APIs to expose applications and datasets. APIs play a crucial role in enabling interactions with systems and data.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain the limitations of Bash scripting in certain scenarios.
- Define what an API is and how it's used to expose applications and data.
- Understand the concepts of a REST API and microservices.
- Recognize the significance of clean and Pythonic code style.
- Work with CSV and JSON formats for data manipulation.
- Organize Python code by adhering to naming conventions.
- Develop scripts that access, organize, and export data using Python.

## Resources

- [Friends donâ€™t let friends program in shell script](https://www.turnkeylinux.org/blog/shell-scripting)
- [What is an API](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api)
- [What is a REST API](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-a-rest-api)
- [What are microservices](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/microservices)
- [PEP8 Python style](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

## Requirements

### General

- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreter: Python 3.8.X
- Files end with a new line
- First line of files: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Imported libraries are organized alphabetically
- Mandatory README.md file at the project's root
- Code should adhere to PEP8 style
- All files must be executable
- Modules must have documentation (use `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- Use `get` to access dictionary values by key (no exceptions for missing keys)
- Code should not execute when imported (use `if __name__ == "__main__":`)

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you should have a basic understanding of Python programming and API concepts. Familiarize yourself with the provided resources for more context.

## Usage

[Explain how to run and use the scripts you'll create. Provide clear instructions.]

## API Documentation

[Provide a link to the API documentation if applicable.]
