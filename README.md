## Introduction to the API

The **Project Name** API is a RESTful API designed to provide [brief description of what the API does and its purpose]. It allows users to [mention key features or use cases of the API].

## Authentication

Authentication is required for some of the API endpoints to ensure the security of the data. The API uses [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) for authentication. To authenticate, include the following header in your requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

## Endpoints

### Endpoint 1: `GET /endpoint1`

[Description of what this endpoint does, what it retrieves, and any query parameters it accepts.]

**Example Request:**

```
GET /endpoint1?param=value
```

**Example Response:**

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "key": "value",
  "array": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

### Endpoint 2: `POST /endpoint2`

[Description of what this endpoint does, what data it expects in the request body, and any other relevant details.]

**Example Request:**

```
POST /endpoint2
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "data": "some_data"
}
```

**Example Response:**

```
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "message": "Resource created successfully"
}
```

## Response Codes

- `200 OK` - The request was successful.
- `201 Created` - A new resource was successfully created.
- `400 Bad Request` - The request was malformed or invalid.
- `401 Unauthorized` - Authentication failed or user does not have necessary permissions.
- `404 Not Found` - The requested resource was not found.
- `500 Internal Server Error` - An error occurred on the server side.

## Error Handling

[Explanation of how errors are communicated in the API responses. You can include a few examples of error responses.]

## Rate Limiting

The API enforces rate limiting to prevent abuse. Users are allowed [mention the rate limit, e.g., 1000 requests per hour]. If the rate limit is exceeded, a `429 Too Many Requests` response will be returned.

## Examples

[Provide a few practical examples of how to use the API endpoints using various programming languages or tools.]

## Contributing

[Information about how others can contribute to the development of the API, including how to submit bug reports or pull requests.]
